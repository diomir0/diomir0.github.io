Hi, how did you end up here? Regardless. I understand it's become common place, not to say desirable, to try and introduce oneself online, for instance by having a tiny website such as this one. This in turn, would allow one to showcase (I do hate that word for some reason) what they can do, and show their worth on the marketplace. I'm going to try and do just that - but please when reading these lines, make your inner voice sounds particularly cynical (Daria-style, kind of).

Now's the time to *actually* introduce myself. As you probably have guessed, **I'm Tim**. Since it is custom to tell people your degree and professional occupation, here you go: I am a **Life Science & Technology** graduate from EPFL, and after an intense yet even more interesting Master's thesis at EPFL's Cognitive Neuroscience Lab, I became involved in **neuroscience research**, first as a PhD student working on how attentional control shapes reading skills (dropped out), then as a research assistant for a project investigating the effects of left angular gyrus tACS stimulation on patients suffering from mild cognitive impairment. That aside, I really like **music** and have pondered for quite some time the idea to pursue a curriculum in either **audio engineering** or **music composition**. I tend to be curious about lots of different things, so be prepared for rather diversified (not to say erratic) content posted here. That is, if I manage to stay motivated enough to write about it.
